\section{Introduction}
As part of the database project we started looking for interesting datasets with different sizes and formats. We paid particular attention that we have at least one memory filling dataset. In the end we choose tree datasets with information about Pain Pill usage, Crime and Yelp all containing information about the city Phoenix in Arizona US. Hence, we came up with the following research question:\\
\begin{center}
\textbf{\emph{Are there correlations between Yelp reviews, pain pill usage and crime rate in Phoenix, Arizona Us.}}
\end{center}
\subsection*{Analysis Goals}
Our research question raised further questions that we would like to take a closer look at.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is there a significant difference of review scores in areas of Phoenix, which correlates to pain pill usage in these areas?
    \item Is there a significant difference of review scores in areas of Phoenix, which correlates to the crime rates of these areas?
    \item Do these areas overlap, if so how?
\end{itemize}
